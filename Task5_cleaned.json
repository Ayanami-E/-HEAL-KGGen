    "question": "Familial Alzheimer's Disease (FAD) results from mutations in certain genes. One such mutation on the PSEN1 gene affects the regulation of Amyloid precursor protein (APP). Given the essential role of γ-secretase in the Notch pathway and its involvement in post-translational modification of both APP and Notch, how might alterations in γ-secretase due to the mutation on PSEN1 affect the development and progression of FAD?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Mutation in PSEN1 leads to hyperactivity of γ-secretase, resulting in overproduction of Amyloid-beta 39 peptides. These peptides, although less prone to aggregation, in excessive quantities lead to the formation of senile plaques that mediate neuronal toxicity and accelerate FAD pathogenesis. In parallel, overactive Notch signaling due to γ-secretase hyperactivity might contribute to neurodegeneration.",
      "B": "PSEN1 mutation influences the preferential cleavage of both APP and Notch by γ-secretase, leading to synchronous dysregulation. This results in an excessive production of P3 peptides from APP, which, despite being less amyloidogenic, induce neurotoxicity when overproduced. Additionally, the altered Notch signaling due to the mutation disturbs the balance between neuronal survival and apoptosis, contributing to FAD progression.",
      "C": "The PSEN1 mutation results in a decreased activity of γ-secretase, leading to an accumulation of APP. This accumulation of uncleaved APP disrupts the homeostatic equilibrium of the cell and results in neuronal damage, thereby hastening the progression of FAD. Concurrently, the mutation also affects the Notch signaling pathway, causing an imbalance in cell differentiation and tissue development.",
      "D": "PSEN1 mutation affects the γ-secretase cleavage site preference causing a shift towards the production of more amyloid-beta 42 peptides, which are more prone to aggregate and lead to plaque formation, hence accelerating FAD progression. These plaques are a characteristic neuropathological feature of FAD."

    "original_answer": "D. Conversion of folic acid to tetrahydrofolate. The conversion of folic acid to tetrahydrofolate is carried out by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, which is not affected by mutations in either the PAH or ABCA1 genes associated with Phenylketonuria or Tangier disease. This pathway is critical for DNA synthesis and repair. Mutations in genes associated with this pathway can lead to certain types of megaloblastic anemia, but are not implicated in Phenylketonuria or Tangier disease."

    "question": "Huntington’s disease, a trinucleotide repeat disorder, is primarily associated with an expansion in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene. However, variations in other genes are also known to influence the age of onset and progression of the disease. Which of the following genetic modifiers has been identified to significantly impact the clinical manifestations of Huntington’s disease by influencing the transcriptional dysregulation pathway?",

    "question": "In the context of chromosomal structural abnormalities, which of the following statements about reciprocal translocations, related genes, and associated diseases is correct?",
    "options": {
      "A": "t(9;22)(q34;q11) is associated with Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia and involves the fusion of the BCR gene on chromosome 9 and the ABL1 gene on chromosome 22, creating a BCR-ABL1 fusion protein that has an increased tyrosine kinase activity. This activity alters the regulation of the cell cycle processes, enhancing cell division and preventing apoptosis, which contributes to the pathogenesis of Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia. Imatinib, a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor, can specifically target and suppress this aberrant fusion protein.",
      "B": "t(15;17) (q24;q21) is associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia and involves the fusion of the PML gene on chromosome 15 and the RARA gene on chromosome 17, leading to the production of a PML-RARA fusion protein that interacts with the retinoic acid receptor. This fusion protein disrupts normal myeloid differentiation leading to a proliferation of immature promyelocytes, characteristic of acute promyelocytic leukemia. Additionally, the fusion protein is sensitive to all-trans retinoic acid, a derivative of vitamin A, which can be used in the treatment of the disease.",
      "C": "t(11;14)(q13;q32) is linked to Mantle Cell Lymphoma and involves the deregulation of the CCND1 gene on chromosome 11 and the IGH gene on chromosome 14. This translocation results in the overproduction of Cyclin D1, a protein essential for cell cycle progression. Overexpression of Cyclin D1 spurs unregulated cell proliferation and the development of Mantle Cell Lymphoma. Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, can be employed to degrade the surplus Cyclin D1 and control the progression of the disease.",
      "D": "t(14;18)(q32;q21) is associated with Follicular Lymphoma and results from the translocation of the BCL2 gene on chromosome 18 to the IGH gene locus on chromosome 14. This rearrangement leads to the overexpression of the BCL2 protein that inhibits apoptosis, leading to accumulation of B-lymphocytes and Follicular Lymphoma. Rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, is used to target the B-cells and manage the disease."
